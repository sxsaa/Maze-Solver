## 7. Usage

Running the Application
```bash
python maze_solver.py
```

### Option 1: Pre-defined Maze

1. Select option **1** when prompted  
2. Choose maze size:
   - `9x9`
   - `16x16`
   - `21x21`
3. Click on the maze to set the **START** point (appears green)  
4. Click on another location to set the **END** point (appears red)  
5. Choose an algorithm:
   - `1` - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
   - `2` - Dijkstra's Algorithm  
   - `3` - A* Search  
6. Watch the algorithm solve the maze in real-time  
7. Press `R` to reset and generate a new maze  

### Option 2: Image Maze

1. Select option **2** when prompted  
2. Enter the **relative path** to your maze image file  
3. Click on the displayed image to select **start** and **end** points  
4. Choose your preferred solving algorithm  
5. View the **solution overlaid** on your original maze image

### 8. Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Time Complexity     | Space Complexity | Optimal  | Description                                                        |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BFS       | O(V + E)            | O(V)             | âœ… Yes   | Explores all nodes at current depth before going deeper           |
| Dijkstra  | O((V + E) log V)    | O(V)             | âœ… Yes   | Finds shortest path considering edge weights                       |
| A*        | O(b^d)              | O(b^d)           | âœ… Yes*  | Uses heuristics to guide search (*if heuristic is admissible)     |

### 9. Supported Image Formats

The application supports the following common image formats:

- **PNG**
- **JPG / JPEG**
- **BMP**
- **TIFF**

#### Image Requirements:

- Black walls, white paths  
- Clear contrast between walls and pathways  
- Reasonable resolution for processing  

---

### 10. Performance Notes

- **Small mazes (9x9):** All algorithms perform similarly  
- **Medium mazes (16x16):** A* typically outperforms others  
- **Large mazes (21x21+):** A* shows significant advantage  
- **Image mazes:** Performance depends on image complexity and resolution

- ### 11. Customization

#### Color Scheme

You can modify the color scheme by editing the `colors` dictionary in the `draw_maze()` function:

```python
colors = {
    "wall": (0, 0, 0),             # Black walls
    "path": (255, 255, 255),       # White paths
    "start": (0, 255, 0),          # Green start
    "end": (255, 0, 0),            # Red end
    "explored": (173, 216, 230),   # Light blue explored
    "current": (255, 165, 0),      # Orange current
    "solution": (0, 0, 255),       # Blue solution path
}
```

### Algorithm Speed
Adjust visualization speed by modifying time.sleep() values inside the algorithm functions.

### 12. Troubleshooting

| Issue                                | Solution                                              |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `No module named 'pygame'`           | Run: `pip install pygame`                             |
| Could not find valid start or end points | Ensure you're clicking on white/path areas          |
| Image not loading                    | Check if the path is correct and image format is supported |
| Slow performance on large images     | Resize images or use smaller maze sizes              |
